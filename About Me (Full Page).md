My name is Zack Augustine, and I am a junior at the University of Missouri (Mizzou). Before I attended Mizzou, I was a student at St. Louis Community College (STLCC). 
Going to a community college to get my associate degree was a very smart plan because it saved me lots of money that would have been spent at Mizzou. 
I was enticed to study at a community college first because I was awarded the A Plus program which paid for two years at STLCC.
My first semester at Mizzou I decided to major in Film Production, I found myself not submitting my best work because of my enthusiasm towards what I thought was my purpose in life.
The last two weeks of the fall semester I spend hours talking to the professors and thinking about my long-term vision.
The spring of that same year I transferred to the School of Engineering to change my major to Information Technology BA.
