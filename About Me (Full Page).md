My name is Zack Augustine, I am a senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou) College of Engineering pursing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Before I attended Mizzou, I was a student at St. Louis Community College-Meramec (STLCC). 

Attending a community college to obtain my Associates Degree was a very smart financial plan because it saved me money. 

I was enticed to study at a community college first because I was awarded the A+ Scholarship Program which paid for my two years at St. Louis Community College-Meramec.

After my first semester at Mizzou, I decided to change my major from Film Production to Information Technology. I discovered that my interests were more about computers and programming than movie making.  The last two weeks of the fall semester I spent hours talking to my professors and rethinking about my long-term vision.

The spring of that same year I transferred to the School of Engineering to change my major to Information Technology.
